## Participate in the development

Branches:

+ origin/master reflects a production-ready state
+ origin/release-* support preparation of a new production release. Allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s
+ origin/hotfix-* support preparation of a new unplanned production release
+ origin/develop reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release (nightly builds)
+ origin/feature- new features for the upcoming or a distant future release

Structure of branches follow strategy of [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/][s]

If you will create new origin/feature-* please open feature request for yourself.

* Anyone may comment you feature here.
* We will have a history for feature and ground for documentation
* If week passed and there wasn't any activity + all tests passed = release a new version ;-)
